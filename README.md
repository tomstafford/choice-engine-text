This project started as notes on a talk, "Free will, Neuroscience and the Power of Reason" given to the [University of Sheffield Secular & Atheist Society](https://www.facebook.com/events/618961544893961) 11 December 2014.

Thanks to Henry Cooke ([@prehensile](https://twitter.com/prehensile)) for advice on bots, Leila Johnston ([@WhosTheSuit](https://twitter.com/WhosTheSuit)), and to those I've talked with about these issues over the years (but who do not necessarily endorse the ideas in this essay), especially Nicol Harper and Laurence Piercy.
